This repo is to compile a list of scripts to see how different methods of
programming in PHP affect overall run time. This is not a "My language is
better than your language" type of measurement. It is just a listing of
different ways to do the same thing to see the true speed benefits.

This is intended to be run via CLI but it can be run through a web server
if you wish (keep in mind that the numbers will vary more.)

This is very similar to http://www.phpbench.com/ by Chris Vincent but I
wanted a way to be able to check out code and run it locally and against
different PHP versions.
